    "#### The first things that comes to my mind are the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. \n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a family of neural networks for analyzing sequential data. RNNs process sequences by iterating through the sequence elements and maintaining a state containing information about what the model has seen so far. One important model of RNNs is the Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM), which leverages the Gate mechanism to determine which information the cell needs to remember and which to forget. However, RNNs including LSTM cannot be trained in parallel, so they are computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers are also designed to handle sequential input data. However, unlike RNNs, transformers do not necessarily process the data in order. They learn contextual relations between words (or sub-words) in a text. Transformers adopt the mechanism of self-attention, which looks at an input sequence and decides at each step which other parts of the sequence are important. It resembles the human brain: When reading this text, you always focus on the word you read but at the same time your mind still holds the important keywords of the text in memory in order to provide context.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not need to process the beginning of the sentence before the end. Rather it identifies the context that confers meaning to each word in the sentence. This feature allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times. The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. It led to the development of pretrained systems such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which were trained with large language datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks."

    "I also open the link in the doc and find that the question and answer are taken from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The work in (Wang and Jiang, 2016) was one of the first to investigate the dataset. The authors proposed an end-to-end architecture based on match-LSTM and pointer networks. (Seo et al., 2016) introduced the bi-directional attention flow network which captures the question-document context at different levels of granularity. \n",
    "(Wang et al., 2017) proposed a gated attention-based recurrent network where self-match attention mechanism is first incorporated. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Devlin et al., 2018) introduced BERT which is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks including question answering."
